These two projects are made with some basic knowledge of html and css.
The portfolio is created using very basic techniques of html and css.
My second project is a webpage on info about coffee and the info is taken from wikipedia.Basically it is a practice webpage created by me to improve my knowledge and skills.
*This website is made according to my desktop view so it may have some issues working on different devices. I am still working on it and will upload the final work soon.
